> “ _I was watching old videos saved on my Mac. Some of the videos were playing fine, but some did not play. Can someone tell me how to fix this issue?”_

 Apple videos are videos downloaded, created, or recorded on various Apple devices like iPhones, iPads, Macs, etc. These videos are known for their high-definition quality, but sometimes, they fail to play on Windows/ Mac or iPhone/Android. This can be due to outdated or faulty media players, an abundance of cache data, incompatible video format, missing video codecs, or file corruption.

 Fortunately, you can fix the**‘Apple videos not playing’** issue with the methods mentioned in this blog.

## **Why Apple Videos are not playing – Possible reasons**

 There can be many reasons for Apple videos not playing on your smartphone or Windows/Mac. Some common causes are:

* The media player does not support the video format.
* Missing or incompatible codecs.
* Media Player glitch or malfunction.
* The smartphone is set to Power-saving mode.
* Cache files occupying lots of storage space on the smartphone.
* Outdated media player.
* Video file corruption.
* Virus or malware infection.
* Interruption during transfer or editing the video.

## **How do you fix Apple videos not playing?**

 Below are a few workarounds you can try to fix: ‘Apple videos not playing’ on iPhone, Android device, Windows, or Mac.

### **Restart your Device & Media Player**

 If your Apple video is not playing on iPhone/Android or Mac/Windows, close all applications and restart your device.

### **Update or Reinstall Media Player**

 When Apple videos are not playing on iPhone/Android, try updating or reinstalling the media player app. To do this, visit the Google Play Store or App Store to reinstall or update the app.

 An outdated media player might be the reason why your Apple videos are not playing on Windows/Mac. Update the existing media player on your system to fix this issue.

 Accumulation of cache and temp files also affects the performance of your Windows/Mac or smartphones. So clear the cache files of your device to fix this problem.

 If Apple videos are not playing on your PC or Mac, clear the cache and temp files from your system. Likewise, clear the cache data of the Android/iPhone so that your device works smoothly and your videos are running fine.

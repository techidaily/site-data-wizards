## **Why your H.264 MOV files turn corrupt?**

 H.264 is a popular video compression format used by DSLRs, digital cameras, drones and many surveillance cameras. These high-quality video files stored in computer, SD card, pen drive, external hard drive etc., may get corrupt due to various reasons like virus infection, corruption in the storage drive, interruption while downloading/ transfer etc.

 The corrupt video often shows errors, stops after playing for some time, throws black screen, loses sound, flickers, gets choppy, broken, or may not play at all.

## **How to repair corrupt H.264 MOV videos**

 A video repair tool is the only solution to repair corruption in H.264 video files. An efficient repair software can fix choppy, jerky, grainy, broken, and truncated videos.

 However, it is not essential that all jerky, slow, or not playing videos are corrupt.

 The H.264 video issues may also arise due to incompatible codecs, unsupported media player or outdated PC drivers. To rule out these factors, begin with few workarounds that may play your H.264 MOV files smoothly again.

### **1\. Play the video in another media player**

 If H.264 MOV video is not playing properly in one player, try another supporting one like VLC Media Player, 5KPlayer, PotPlayer, QuickTime etc.

### **6\. Turn Off hardware acceleration**

 Sometimes the problems could be due to hardware acceleration. When enabled, hardware acceleration passes graphical intensive tasks within the browser to make it perform better.

To disable hardware acceleration in Google Chrome, follow these steps:

1. On the Chrome toolbar, click Settings > Advanced
2. Under System, toggle-off the Use hardware acceleration when available option

 If your H.264 videos don’t play properly, after the above workarounds, they are corrupt. Use a H.264 video repair application to fix the problem.

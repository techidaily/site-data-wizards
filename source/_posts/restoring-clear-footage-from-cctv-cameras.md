## **Why CCTV Video Footage is Not Playing?**

 There are several reasons why your CCTV video won’t play on Windows or Mac. Some of them are:

**Incompatible Video Format**

 If the CCTV videos transferred from the camera’s SD card are incompatible with your Mac or Windows media player, they may not open or play.

**Unsupported Video Codec**

 If your Windows/Mac media player does not support the CCTV videos’ codec, the videos might crash or not play.

**Corrupted Video Footage**

 A corrupt CCTV footage will not work on Mac/Windows. A video footage gets corrupted when the CCTV camera abruptly shuts down while recording.

## **How to fix CCTV Videos Not Playing Issue?**

 CCTV videos not opening or playing can be frustrating when you need to watch a recorded video urgently to retrieve a lost asset or review a past event. Here are some common CCTV videos not working scenarios and how to solve them.

### **Choppy or Blurry CCTV Videos**

 Choppy or blurry CCTV videos are caused by an interruption during video transfer from an SD card to the computer, an outdated media player, a corrupt SD card, or corrupt video footage.

 In such a situation, play the CCTV video in another media player, download the required codec, or [repair choppy or jerky video](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/) using Stellar Repair for Video.

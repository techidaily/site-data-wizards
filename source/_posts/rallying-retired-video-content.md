### 2\. VLC Media Player

 The VLC video player provides an automated repair process to fix video files. But it only fixes faulty or damaged AVI-formatted videos.

 It will first be essential to convert the format. However, the VLC player also has conversion features.

* Open **VLC** , then select **Preferences**  from the **Tools** drop-down menu (You can also access the **Preferences** option by hitting **Ctrl + P** .)

* Click **Start** after selecting the correct encapsulation (**AVI**) and specifying a location for your video in the profile menu.

### 3\. Update Drivers

 The Graphics card and driver are responsible for video playbacks and displaying other media on the screen. You can update your drivers by following the steps below.

* Right-click on the**Start Menu** and select**Device Manager** from the list.

* Select the**Display Adapter** to expand the category.
* Update the driver by right-clicking on the**Graphic Card** and selecting the**Update** option.

* Then select**Search automatically for drivers** .

* Try to play the video file after updating. If the graphic card is updated, this should fix the recovered video if the problem is with the update.

### 4\. Downloading Compatible Codec

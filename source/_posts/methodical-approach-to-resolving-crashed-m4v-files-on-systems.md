 M4V is a video file container format developed by Apple Inc. to encode video files in its iTunes store. Its usage is limited to Apple products only (iPhone, iPad Air, iPad Pro, iPod, MacBook, iTunes store, etc.) to support video files. However, due to its great compression and low-bandwidth requirement, it is one of the most popular video container formats streaming on the internet.

 Generally, the files purchased from the iTunes store are protected by Apple’s FairPlay DRM copy protection aiming to restrict piracy and unauthorized distribution of the files, which means that the protected files cannot be played on non-Apple devices. To play M4V videos, you need to have an authorized iTunes account to purchase the video; however, M4V files can be played on different media players simply by changing the file extension from .m4v to .mp4 if not DRM – protected.

## **What might corrupt or damage M4V video files?**

* _Abrupt shutdown of the device._
* _Unsupported media player._
* _Faulty Codecs._
* _Bad segments in the hard drive._
* _Compatibility issues (Slow processors, outdated video card drivers)._
* _Files downloaded from unreliable sources with bad patches._
* _Malicious spyware, virus intrusion._

### **Below are some suggestions that can be followed to fix the corrupt or damaged M4V files:**

1. **Faulty Codecs** : Codecs are programs that encode or decode received data for faster transmission and are activated only when a specific multimedia file requests for it to be activated. If the codec is absent or isn’t functioning properly, then the associated multimedia file won’t be able to work properly too. In addition, missing codecs will hinder the video file from working properly when you try and open it. Therefore, download and install the correct codec packs.
2. **Download from a reliable source:** If you have downloaded the video file via uTorrent, then the chances are that you haven’t downloaded the reliable or appropriate torrent file. You don’t have to download the file again.
3. **Update Video Drivers:** Not having the latest version of video drivers can also hinder working M4V files. Thus, it is advisable to use the updated video drivers and check for the latest drivers’ availability.
4. **Memory Upgradation:** Consider upgrading the memory system as sometimes, lack of storage results in improper processing and working of the video files. Furthermore, additional memory provides the system with useful resources or the missing features to run the M4V files smoothly.

 If none of the above suggestions works, then you should go for a professional and reliable video repair tool, i.e.,**Stellar Repair for Video** . It is one of the most powerful tools to [fix corrupt video files](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/) .

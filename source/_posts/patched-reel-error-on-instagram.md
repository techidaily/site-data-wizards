**Summary:** In this guide, we will share some easy-to-understand techniques that anyone can use to troubleshoot and fix Instagram reel glitching issues. We'll also understand the common causes behind this issue and walk you through a simple and effective video repair tool that can help you fix a glitching or corrupt video.

 As content creators, we know the trouble when your social media video malfunctions or faces an Instagram reel glitching issue. It’s a common problem that many social media users can go through, but do you know why such problems occur in the first place, or how to get them working again? Well, there are some simple steps you can take to fix it. In this blog, we are going to understand the specific issues with Instagram reel glitch errors and several ways to fix Instagram reel glitch.

## Understanding Instagram Reel Glitch Issue

 Instagram reels are an entertaining way to socialize and connect with friends and followers; they can also help you build and grow your brand globally. Therefore, as a video or content creator, ensure the reels remain free from any glitches or errors for your viewers. However, accidents may occur, and you may face glitches in your Instagram reel.

 To fix Instagram reel glitch issue, we need to understand what exactly causes these glitches. Let’s first understand them to start with the troubleshooting:

### Slow Network Error

 One of the most common issues that can cause issues & glitches in your Instagram reel is poor network connectivity. Suppose you or any of your viewers are trying to watch Instagram reels on a weak Wi-Fi or data connection. In that case, the [video may not be able to load properly](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/) or load too slowly, freeze frequently, buffer too much, or not play at all.

### Device Incompatibility

 In most cases, an outdated or incompatible smartphone device can also cause Instagram reel glitching issues. Since Instagram reels are a relatively new feature, they require a minimum of hardware and software capabilities to run properly. If you have an older or lower-end smartphone, it may not be able to process the reel video smoothly, resulting in more glitches, audio issues, and poor playback.

### Outdated Application

 Apart from having an outdated device, having an outdated Instagram app on your phone can lead to reel glitches. Instagram often introduces new updates to its application to introduce new features, fix minor bugs and glitches, and improve app performance. Therefore, running on an outdated Instagram app can limit it from performing optimally and cause glitches or errors in the reel/video playback.

### Instagram Downtime

 Sometimes, the reel glitches can be caused due to server or software-related issues in Instagram; hence, such errors may not be in our control. In such situations, it’s better to wait for Instagram to fix server issues at their end. You can check various Instagram or [social media downtime websites](https://downdetector.com/social-media/) and the Instagram help center to see if they’ve reported the issue and are working on a fix.

 By understanding the above causes of Instagram reel glitches, you’ll be able to resolve any playback issues that arise.

### Corrupt Video

 Apart from the above issues, an Instagram Video Reel may also act up because of a corrupt video file uploaded to Instagram. A corrupt video file will lead to playback issues and glitches, thus preventing smooth playback for viewers. Therefore, it is important to ensure that any video you upload to Instagram should be free of corruption or related errors.

### Remove App Cache and Temporary Files

 Another quick and easy way to fix Instagram reel glitch issue is to clear your device’s app cache or temporary files. Our smartphone devices may face performance issues due to unnecessary cache files stored by the Instagram app. The best way to clear Instagram cache is by using a cleaner app, which can help remove any temporary cache data or unnecessary files.

* Simply go to your device settings and look for the Instagram app.
* You can also long-press the Instagram app until the**App Info/Details** pops up.
* Open the**App Info** tab and go to the**Storage** **and Cache** option from the menu.
* Now, select the**“clear cache”** option. This may also log you out of the Instagram app.

 This step will free up space and might fix your glitching Instagram reel.

 By following these simple steps, you can fix any temporary Instagram issues. However, for a more serious issue that does not involve the device, application, or internet, you can apply the software solution provided in the next section.

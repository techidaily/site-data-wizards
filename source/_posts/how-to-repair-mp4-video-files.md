 But it is no more agonizing over the lost videos. Instead, we will share how you can repair MP4 files in the playable and pristine form again.

## **Why do your MP4 videos turn corrupt?**

 There can be many reasons for MP4 file corruption. Foremost is the digital media in which you store video files.

## **How to Fix Corrupt MP4 Files**

 You can repair damaged or corrupted videos with the help of MP4 repair software.

 But note that if a video is not playing or showing an error, it may not necessarily be corrupt. The problem can be with the device or media player you use to play MP4 videos. So, before getting on to a MP4 video repair software, try these troubleshooting methods to fix damaged MP4 videos:

### **Fix Damaged or Unplayable MP4 Videos Without Software**

#### **1\. Play the video in another Media Player**

 Media players are not compatible with every video format. Although media players mostly support MP4, technical issues can still occur. So change the media player. Then, play your MP4 files in VLC Media Player, Winamp, KMPlayer, or others to see if it works. If not, jump to next step.

#### **2\. Convert the video file format**

 If MP4 videos are not playing, convert the file format, such as MP4 to MOV, MP4 to AVI, and so on. You can choose any online MP4 converter program or desktop conversion software like [**Stellar Converter for Audio Video**](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/) .

 VLC Media Player can also convert MP4 videos to a different file format.

 **Here, just see how to use VLC Media Player to convert MP4 files to other formats:**

* Open VLC Media Player on your Mac/Windows. (Here we used Mac.)
* Click the**File** option at the top and select the**Convert/Stream** option.

* Click on the**Open Media button** and select one or more MP4 videos you want to transcode. Select the**Customize** option next to the**Choose** **Profile** .

* Navigate to the**Encapsulation tab** , and select any**file** **format** , like, for example, AVI. Click**Apply** .

* Click the**Save as File** button at the bottom of the**Convert & Stream** window.

* Click **Browse** to select the location to save your converted video, and remember to give a proper name to your file. Then click**Save.**

 After transcoding, play the converted video in VLC or any other media player.

#### **3\. Download MP4 Codecs**

 A codec is used to compress or decompress a video file. Every video file format has an audio and video codec. For example, MP4 file types use MPEG-4 codec to compress video and AAC compression for audio. If your media player doesn’t have these codecs, it cannot play an MP4 file and may show errors, such as _‘A codec is required to play this file.’_

 The solution is to download the right codecs. You can also get a codec pack online, such as Media Player Codec pack, X codec pack, or K-Lite or Perian for your PC or Mac computer. A pack would contain codecs for most video file types, including MP4.

**Warning:** Always download video codecs from their official website. Downloading from an untrusted source can put your computer at virus or malware risk.

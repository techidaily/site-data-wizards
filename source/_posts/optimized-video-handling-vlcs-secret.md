### **Method 2: Increase cache values in VLC Player**

**Steps to increase cache value in VLC:**

* Open VLC Player.
* Go to**Tools** \>**Preferences** .
* At the bottom-left corner, under**Show settings,** select ‘**All** .’

* In the left pane, click**Input/ Codecs** from the list.
* On the right pane, scroll down to the**Advanced** section.

* At the bottom-left corner, under**Show settings,** select ‘**All** .’

* In the left pane, click**Input/ Codecs** from the list.

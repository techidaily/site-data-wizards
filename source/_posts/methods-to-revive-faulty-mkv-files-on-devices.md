 There are various video file formats supported across different media players. MOV is yet another popular file format, used by Apple devices. One of the most popular media players is QuickTime, which uses the MOV file format majorly used in Mac OS. However, there are many other media players, which support MOV files. In addition, there are devices like CCTV and HD cameras that capture the video in MOV file format.  
  
 There are instances when such file formats fail to open or become inaccessible. It could be due to a software failure, or any interruption while transferring the file. In addition, there are various other reasons like the use of poor video editors or improper downloads that can make the MOV or any other video file corrupt. A corrupt or damaged MOV file fails to open in any media player including QuickTime. However, there are ways using which such issues can be fixed. The best way is to use professional software that is compatible with Mac OS.

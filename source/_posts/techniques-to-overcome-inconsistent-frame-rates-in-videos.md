### **1\. Re-download /Copy Videos Again**

 It is possible that your video was not transferred properly or downloaded from the source. So try re-downloading or transferring the file. The method works if the video is not deleted from the source or you haven’t performed ‘**Cut** ’ and ‘**Paste** ’ action.

### **2\. Play Videos on Another Media Player**

 Instead of playing the video in your default media player, try to play it on another media player. For instance, consider playing videos on VLC Player, who knows it might just work and fix the choppy or jerky videos. VLC Player is an open-source media player, which is compatible with all type of devices.

### **3\. Clear Browser’s Cache and Cookies**

 If you face choppy video streaming, clear your browser’s temporary and cache files. You can do this by going to the settings of whichever browser you are using.

**Steps to delete browser cache & cookies on Chrome:**

* Open Google Chrome browser.
* Click on**Settings** .
* Go to**Advanced > Privacy and security.**
* Click on**Clear browsing data.**

 _If the streaming videos in Chrome, Mozilla, or other browser shows error,[learn how to fix it here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/) _

### **4\. Convert Video to Different Format**

 Video may not play properly in your media player due to incompatible format. Converting it to different format may help.

 You may use trusted desktop converter application such as [Stellar Converter for Audio Video](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/) that is quick to convert video file formats without degrading quality. It also lets you edit your videos.

 There are online converter tools like Convertio and Zamzar available, which you can try.

### **5\. Reduce the Video Size and Resolution**

 Try reducing the size and resolution of choppy video and then play it. This might work in case of high-resolution videos. For instance, if the video’s resolution is 1080p 30fps, reduce it to 720p resolution. Your system will have to work less in playing the low resolution video file.

**How to reduce video size to smooth play choppy video**

 Compress the video file or resize it by trimming some video segments. You can use video compressor applications available for Android, PC or Mac.

 Commonly used, VLC Media Player can also compress videos. To trim video segments and reduce resolution, frame rate, or bitrate**Stellar Converter for Audio Video** is a good option. The software is available for Windows and Mac.

 For online videos such as YouTube or Vimeo, you can lower the video quality by going into the video settings option.

### **6\. Update Your Computer Drivers**

**Follow these steps to reinstall the drivers:**

1. Go to**Device Manager** and expand ‘**Sound, video and game controller’.**
2. Locate the device that you want to update, right-click on the device name, and select ‘**Update Driver Software’.**

### **7\. Check Your Computer Configuration**

 Is your computer equipped enough to play high quality HD, UHD, or Full HD videos? Before playing the videos, ensure that your computer meets the minimum system requirements. To play videos with higher resolution (1080p 60 fps and higher), it is recommended to have at least 3.0 – 3.7 GHz of processors, at least 6 GB RAM with a robust video card (GeForce GT 650M). A stronger processor and graphics card improves your system performance as well as the HD video experience.

 VLC Media Player is one of the most compatible and user-friendly media players. It can play almost all video file types from any source stored on hard drives, SD cards, CD/ DVD, and others.

 But as technical glitches can occur anytime, videos may start to stutter, freeze, or show audio lags in VLC Player. This is commonly reported while playing large-sized HD or UHD videos, such as movies, animated films, etc. The HD or UHD videos don’t play smoothly and skip frames or freeze in VLC.

 **_‘When I watch the 1080p H265 .mp4 movie file, the VLC Player freezes randomly after about 5 minutes. However, I can hear the audio track, but the video lags. Can I fix this?’_**

 Here are the six best solutions to fix Video Stuck or Frozen in VLC.

## Solutions to fix video stuck, stuttering, buffering or lagging in VLC Media Player

 Although there isn’t a set solution, changing the VLC media player’s settings can work. You may have to try various methods shared here to fix the video freeze or lag issues in VLC Media Player.

 You can apply the solutions here to play high-quality HD/ UHD/ HDR, 8k, or H.265 videos of any size and file format.

### **Method 1: Update VLC Media Player to the latest version**

 If your videos freeze, stutter, or are not playing in VLC Media Player, first update the player to the latest version. The updates improve support for new HD codecs, advanced formats, HDR, H.265/HEVC, 4K & 8K playback, 360-degree videos, VP9 (HD videos at lower bitrates), and others for decoding and encoding. It also fixes streaming issues and bugs, if any.

### **Method 2: Increase cache values in VLC Player**

 VLC Player preloads video cache files in the computer’s RAM to properly access and plays the video. You can try to fix the video buffering issue by increasing the cache value. However, this would increase the number of seconds videos are cached to play in VLC Player.

**Steps to increase cache value in VLC:**

* Open VLC Player.
* Go to**Tools** \>**Preferences** .
* At the bottom-left corner, under**Show settings,** select ‘**All** .’

* In the left pane, click**Input/ Codecs** from the list.
* On the right pane, scroll down to the**Advanced** section.

* In the**Advanced** section, across**File caching (ms),** change the value to 1000 or above.
* Click**Save.** Next, restart VLC Player and check if the videos are playing properly.

### **Method 3: Disable Hardware Decoding in VLC Player**

 VLC Media Player can use the GPU of a computer to accelerate video decoding in high-quality videos. However, your PC’s drivers may behave abruptly, resulting in video playback or streaming issues. You can try disabling hardware decoding to fix Video Stuck or Freeze in the VLC player.

**Steps to disable hardware decoding in VLC:**

1. Open VLC Media Player.
2. Go to**Tools** \>**Preferences** .
3. At the bottom-left corner, under**Show settings,** select ‘**All** .’
4. In the left pane, click**Input/ Codecs** from the list.

* Click **Save** . Restart VLC Payer to enable the changes.

### **Method 4: Change FFmpeg settings in VLC Player**

 Making changes in the FFmpeg video codec in VLC Player has worked for some. You can also try to resolve video stuttering and freezing with this technique.

* Open VLC Media Player.
* Go to**Tools** \>**Preferences.**

* At the bottom-left corner, under**Show settings,** select ‘**All** .’

* In the left pane, click**Input/ Codecs** from the list.
* Click**Video Codecs > FFmpeg** .

* Under**FFmpeg audio/video decoder** _,_ scroll down to**Skip the loop filter for H.264 decoding** option. Set it to ‘**All** .’

* Click**Save** .

### **Method 5: Switch video output to DirectX DirectDraw in VLC**

 Try switching between output video stream settings in the VLC media player. For example, you can set the output video module to Direct 3D video output, DirectX DirectDraw, or Open GL video output.

**Steps to change video output in VLC:**

* Open**VLC** **Media Player** .
* Click and follow**Tools > Preferences** .

* In the**Preferences** window, click on**Reset Preferences.**

* In the confirmation dialog box, click**OK.**
* Again, go to**Tools > Preferences** .

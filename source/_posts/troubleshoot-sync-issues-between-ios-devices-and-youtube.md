### 5.**Turn off VPN on iPhone**

 Have you set up a VPN on your iPhone to browse Internet privately? VPN stops access to certain online content geography-wise. Maybe that’s the reason for YouTube videos not playing on your iPhone. To fix YouTube videos not playing on iPhone, turn off VPN.

 On your iPhone, move to**Settings > General** and toggle off VPN slider to disconnect.

### 6.**Clear the iPhone cache**

 Apps and browsing activities create cache, cookies, and temp files on iPhone. These non-essential files pile up and affect your iOS device performance and occupy storage space. So cache and cookies could be a reason for YouTube not working on iPhone. Delete cache and cookies to improve your iPhone’s performance and speed. This would eventually resolve YouTube [video errors](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/) on iPhone.

**To clear cache data of iPhone apps follow the below steps:**

* Open the**Settings** **\> General** .
* Select iPhone Storage.

* You will see the list of your apps, select the YouTube app. Click on Offload App.

* You can also click on**Enable** against Offload Unused Apps from the menu. This will clear cache and other unnecessary data of all your unused iPhone apps.

### 7.**Decrease video playback quality in YouTube**

 Slow or poor Internet connection can cause YouTube video playback or loading errors. If you can’t fix the Internet issue and desperately want to access YouTube, decrease its video quality from the settings.

 Although not in high quality, the video will play in an acceptable resolution without any buffering or error.

**To reduce video quality in YouTube follow the given steps:**

* Open the video in YouTube.
* Click on the 3 dots.

* Select**Quality > Advanced** .

* Select a lower video quality from the options. The resolution 360p would suffice to play on a slow Internet.

### 8.**Play the shared video in the YouTube app on iPhone**

 Are the YouTube videos shared on Viber, WhatsApp, Telegram etc., not playing? You may be trying to open and watch them inside the chat application.

 Instead, try to open the videos in the YouTube app. If the videos don’t play in the YouTube app, copy the link and play from the Safari browser on iPhone.

### 9.**Re-sign into your YouTube account**

 So if YouTube is not working on iPhone, sign out of the application once. Then sign in again to open your YouTube account.

**To sign out of your YouTube account on iPhone:**

* Click on your profile photo and tap on the account name.

* Click**Switch Account** option.
* Click on**Use YouTube Signed Out** option.

 **To sign in again on YouTube on iPhone:**

### 12.**Disable Incognito mode in YouTube**

 You cannot use YouTube fully in Incognito mode. The Incognito mode in YouTube only allows watching videos privately without saving your searches or activity. However, the private mode doesn’t let you engage with a YouTube video. This means you cannot like, comment, share, subscribe to a channel, or save YouTube videos. You won’t be able to see your subscriptions also in Incognito mode.

 So if YouTube videos are not working on iPhone, check and turn off the Incognito mode.

**Steps to turn off Incognito mode in YouTube on iPhone:**

* Open YouTube app and tap on the profile picture.

* Click on**Turn off Incognito** . Now, YouTube will start working as usual.

### 13.**Reset Network Settings of iPhone**

 YouTube videos not working on iPhone could be a network issue. Try to fix the issue by resetting your iPhone network. When you reset network settings, the internet and network information changes to default without deleting your other data on your iPhone. All the previous networks, WiFi, Bluetooth and VPN settings are also deleted.

 How to reset network settings on iPhone to fix YouTube not working issue:

* Open the Settings app.
* Move to**Settings > Transfer or Reset iPhone** . (in new iPhones only**Reset**)

* Click on**Reset** .

* Click on**Reset Network Settings** .

### 14.**Uninstall and Reinstall YouTube app on iPhone**

 When no other troubleshooting works, uninstall the YouTube app and then reinstall it on your iPhone. Now check if this fixes YouTube on iPhone or iPad.

 Uninstalling YouTube will erase all the settings and cache data. However, this won’t delete your YouTube account. You can again login with the same Apple ID after reinstalling, and [recover saved videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/) and subscriptions in your YouTube account.

**Here’s how to reinstall YouTube on iPhone:**

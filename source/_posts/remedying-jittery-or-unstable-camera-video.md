 CCTV cameras are indispensable in today’s world where people need to monitor their homes or offices constantly. They help keep your premises safe from theft/ break-in attempts and let you stay vigilant about your assets, kids, pets, etc.

 Popular CCTV cameras like Hikvision, Adiance, Vmukti, Bosch, SimpliCam, Google Nest, etc. are known for their ability to record high-quality video and wide-angle monitoring. These videos are stored locally on the CCTV camera’s SD card or on cloud storage.

 However, users often complain about various errors with CCTV camera videos, such as**CCTV videos not playing** on Windows/Mac, choppy or distorted videos, errors while transferring, etc.

**Corrupted Video Footage**

 A corrupt CCTV footage will not work on Mac/Windows. A video footage gets corrupted when the CCTV camera abruptly shuts down while recording.

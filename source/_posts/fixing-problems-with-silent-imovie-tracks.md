### **Restart your Device & Media Player**

 If your Apple video is not playing on iPhone/Android or Mac/Windows, close all applications and restart your device.

 You can even try to close the media player and then launch it again to see if the video is working. If this doesn’t work, move to the next method.

### **Use another Media Player**

 You can use VLC Media Player, KMPlayer, QuickTime Player, Windows Media Player, etc., to play your Apple video if it is not working on your regular media player.

### **Update or Reinstall Media Player**

 When Apple videos are not playing on iPhone/Android, try updating or reinstalling the media player app. To do this, visit the Google Play Store or App Store to reinstall or update the app.

### **Download the required codecs**

 If a necessary codec is missing or incompatible with your media player, your video may not play on your Windows or Mac.

 So, download the missing codec pack from its authorized website and check if your Apple video plays.

### **Close all other applications**

 If multiple apps are running in the background, they eat up your phone’s CPU, slowing down the processor and draining the phone’s battery fast.

 So, you must close all open applications after using them. Moreover, avoid opening multiple applications at a time. Play your Apple videos after closing all the background applications on your iPhone or Android device.

### **Clear Cache Files**

 Accumulation of cache and temp files also affects the performance of your Windows/Mac or smartphones. So clear the cache files of your device to fix this problem.

 If Apple videos are not playing on your PC or Mac, clear the cache and temp files from your system. Likewise, clear the cache data of the Android/iPhone so that your device works smoothly and your videos are running fine.

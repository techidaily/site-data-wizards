### 2\. VLC Media Player

 The VLC video player provides an automated repair process to fix video files. But it only fixes faulty or damaged AVI-formatted videos.

 It will first be essential to convert the format. However, the VLC player also has conversion features.

* Open **VLC** , then select **Preferences**  from the **Tools** drop-down menu (You can also access the **Preferences** option by hitting **Ctrl + P** .)

### 3\. Update Drivers

* Right-click on the**Start Menu** and select**Device Manager** from the list.

* Select the**Display Adapter** to expand the category.
* Update the driver by right-clicking on the**Graphic Card** and selecting the**Update** option.

* Then select**Search automatically for drivers** .

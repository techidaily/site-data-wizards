 ‘Advance Repair’ feature is added to deliver more power and better performance to the software.

Significantly increasing the success rate of video repair, ‘Advance Repair’ is also a relief for those who lose their videos due to severe corruption.

 The feature uses the technique of ‘Sample File’ as reference to repair videos that are severely corrupt.

 CCTV cameras are indispensable in today’s world where people need to monitor their homes or offices constantly. They help keep your premises safe from theft/ break-in attempts and let you stay vigilant about your assets, kids, pets, etc.

 Popular CCTV cameras like Hikvision, Adiance, Vmukti, Bosch, SimpliCam, Google Nest, etc. are known for their ability to record high-quality video and wide-angle monitoring. These videos are stored locally on the CCTV camera’s SD card or on cloud storage.

 However, users often complain about various errors with CCTV camera videos, such as**CCTV videos not playing** on Windows/Mac, choppy or distorted videos, errors while transferring, etc.

 In this blog post, we’ll discuss why CCTV camera videos are not playing on your computer and share ways to repair CCTV footage in different scenarios.

## **Why CCTV Video Footage is Not Playing?**

 There are several reasons why your CCTV video won’t play on Windows or Mac. Some of them are:

**Incompatible Video Format**

 If the CCTV videos transferred from the camera’s SD card are incompatible with your Mac or Windows media player, they may not open or play.

**Unsupported Video Codec**

 If your Windows/Mac media player does not support the CCTV videos’ codec, the videos might crash or not play.

**Corrupted Video Footage**

 A corrupt CCTV footage will not work on Mac/Windows. A video footage gets corrupted when the CCTV camera abruptly shuts down while recording.

## **How to fix CCTV Videos Not Playing Issue?**

 CCTV videos not opening or playing can be frustrating when you need to watch a recorded video urgently to retrieve a lost asset or review a past event. Here are some common CCTV videos not working scenarios and how to solve them.

### **Choppy or Blurry CCTV Videos**

 Choppy or blurry CCTV videos are caused by an interruption during video transfer from an SD card to the computer, an outdated media player, a corrupt SD card, or corrupt video footage.

 In such a situation, play the CCTV video in another media player, download the required codec, or [repair choppy or jerky video](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/) using Stellar Repair for Video.

 If your SD card is corrupted, reformat it, and then use a professional photo recovery tool to recover lost CCTV videos from the formatted card.

### **Black Screen while playing CCTV Videos**

 If you see a black screen error while playing CCTV videos on your PC, it can be due to a missing codec, file corruption, outdated display driver, or incomplete video transfer.

 You can update the display driver, transfer the video again, or change the video format to [fix the black screen error](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/) .

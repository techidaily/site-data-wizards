### 1\. Stellar Repair for Video

 Your first choice for fixing the “**recovered video files not playing** ” problem should be a well-designed, safe, and secure video repair software. The only software with these qualities in the market is Stellar Repair for Video. Stellar Repair for Video fixes problems with the file headers or formats and fixes files you can’t play.

 Plus, it corrects issues with playback, such as unplayable, stuttering, flickering, black screens, out-of-sync, choppy, jerky, truncated, grainy, frozen, blurred, and other issues. In other words, it is a comprehensive restoration tool that will eliminate the need for many supplementary programs to restore a video.

 Another point that we should highlight is how simple the repair procedure is. You can complete it without expert assistance in under a minute. Other programs, like VLC media player, mentioned in the article, are difficult to use and have a confusing user interface, making it easy for users to become lost in the settings while trying to fix videos.

 Ultimately, it is compatible with most media capture equipment, including Sony cameras, CCTV, and security cameras. This feature makes it the perfect choice for store or supermarket owners and professional photographers and videographers.

Here’s how to utilize the application:

* First, download and install [**Stellar Repair for Video**](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/) from the official website.
* Next, launch **Stellar Repair for Video** software and in the first window, click on **Add file** .

* Here, you can browse and select the video you want to repair using**Stellar Repair for Video** and then select **Repair** .

* Wait patiently as the software repairs your file.

* After the process, you can preview the repaired file or run the **Advanced Repair** process.

* Finally, click on **Save Repaired Files** to save the video files.

* If you select **Advanced Repair,** a window will appear asking for a video sample. The video sample needs to be recorded by the same media capture device with which you captured the damaged video. Choose **Next** .

* Click **Browse** , then choose the necessary **Sample**  file from the list of options. Finally, select **Apply** to use the sample file you’ve chosen to fix all the corrupt video files in the list by applying it to all files with the same format.

* After you’ve added the sample video, click the **Repair** button. A dialog window titled **Repair process completed** displays after the process. Click **OK** .

* Click **Save Repaired Files** . A dialog box appears with options to save repaired files at the source or a different location if you want to save the file somewhere else.

### 2\. VLC Media Player

 The VLC video player provides an automated repair process to fix video files. But it only fixes faulty or damaged AVI-formatted videos.

 It will first be essential to convert the format. However, the VLC player also has conversion features.

* Download the [**VLC media player**](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) and install it (If you download the portable version, it doesn’t need installation.)
* Open **VLC** , then select **Preferences**  from the **Tools** drop-down menu (You can also access the **Preferences** option by hitting **Ctrl + P** .)

* Navigate to the **Input / Codecs** section. In the **Damaged or incomplete AVI file** menu, choose **Always fix** . Click **Save** after.

* Select **Media** . Choose **Convert / Save** and then **Add** the damaged MP4 file. After adding, click on **Convert/Save** .

* Click **Start** after selecting the correct encapsulation (**AVI**) and specifying a location for your video in the profile menu.

### 3\. Update Drivers

 The Graphics card and driver are responsible for video playbacks and displaying other media on the screen. You can update your drivers by following the steps below.

* Right-click on the**Start Menu** and select**Device Manager** from the list.

* Select the**Display Adapter** to expand the category.
* Update the driver by right-clicking on the**Graphic Card** and selecting the**Update** option.

* Then select**Search automatically for drivers** .

* Try to play the video file after updating. If the graphic card is updated, this should fix the recovered video if the problem is with the update.

### 4\. Downloading Compatible Codec

 Download the most recent H.264 MPEG codec and other necessary codecs from the internet. It might fix the corrupt video file that was recovered. Unfortunately, the video becomes unplayable on local storage and in the browser if your PC lacks any important video codecs.

### Conclusion! Bring Back Your Precious Videos

 Unreliable media players can severely damage your videos, causing problems like “recovered mp4 files not playing”. Likewise, data recovery programs can damage your files in the recovery process. Therefore, we recommend you use Stellar products first since the company offers reliable and secure products.

 Unfortunately, you cannot install the Stellar Repair for Video or Stellar Data Recovery tool directly on your smartphone. But you can connect your phone to the PC to recover lost or transfer damaged files to repair with Stellar Repair for Videos.

### **1\. Re-download /Copy Videos Again**

For instance, consider playing videos on VLC Player, who knows it might just work and fix the choppy or jerky videos.

### **4\. Convert Video to Different Format**

 Video may not play properly in your media player due to incompatible format. Converting it to different format may help.

**How to reduce video size to smooth play choppy video**

 Compress the video file or resize it by trimming some video segments. You can use video compressor applications available for Android, PC or Mac.

 Commonly used, VLC Media Player can also compress videos. To trim video segments and reduce resolution, frame rate, or bitrate**Stellar Converter for Audio Video** is a good option. The software is available for Windows and Mac.

 For online videos such as YouTube or Vimeo, you can lower the video quality by going into the video settings option.

1. Go to**Device Manager** and expand ‘**Sound, video and game controller’.**
2. Locate the device that you want to update, right-click on the device name, and select ‘**Update Driver Software’.**

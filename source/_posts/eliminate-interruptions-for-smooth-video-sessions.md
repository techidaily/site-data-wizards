 Today, new modes of entertainment like video streams, reels, live videos, etc., impact the media consumption patterns of all users.

 Video streaming, or simply streaming, is the most popular way of consuming media. Streaming refers to watching a video online without the need to download it. However, sometimes, viewers face various video streaming issues like buffering, low video quality, stuttering, etc., that could disrupt the stream and negatively affect the viewing experience. Let’s look at some of the ways to fix multiple video streaming problems.

 But Before that, do you know what makes for an ideal video stream? Here’s what makes for a seamless viewing experience.

## Various Video Streaming Issues Faced By the Viewers –

* Corrupt files
* Missing codecs or plug-ins
* Video flickering

## Methods to resolve video streaming issues –

### 1\. Internet Connectivity

 Internet Connectivity is the most crucial element of any video stream. Streaming a video on a poor internet connection can cause severe disruptions like [choppy video](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/) , poor video quality, etc. resulting in a distorted viewing experience. Low bandwidth and a higher number of connected devices to the same Wi-Fi can cause various internet issues. Switching to a different Wi-Fi with higher bandwidth or connecting only one or two devices simultaneously can help resolve this issue.

### 2\. Switch to Another Streaming Platform

 If you have a steady internet connection with decent speed and bandwidth, you can easily stream a video from any website. You can try switching to a different platform to check if the video is playing perfectly on that platform. By doing so, you can also compare the performance of your existing platform with the new platform.

### 3\. Change the Video Quality

 High-definition videos are visually stunning and offer a great viewing experience. Running an HD video stream requires good internet speed and bandwidth, if you don’t have either, you’ll probably face video streaming issues like flickering, lagging, out-of-sync audio-video, etc. You can try lowering the video quality to resolve the issue. You can also pause the video and wait for it to buffer before playing it.

### 4\. Restart Your Device

 This simple method can fix various issues with your video stream. You can simply switch off and restart your system & the Wi-Fi router to see if the issue has been resolved or not.

### 5\. Close, Reopen & Update the App

 Sometimes, the issue could be due to the streaming app. Try closing the app once and restarting it again to see if the issue is resolved. If not, check if you’re using the latest version of the app; update if required, and then try to play the video again.

### 6\. App Cache

 In some cases, the app cache could also cause of a bad video stream. You can try clearing the app cache as over time cache buildup could cause different video streaming errors. Play your video stream after clearing the app cache to check if the issue is resolved.

### 7\. Location Permissions

 Denied location permissions to the app or the website can sometimes cause issues with your video stream. Location-based streaming issues are rare but could occur. First, check the VPN settings to see whether the location or the internet speed has been altered. Also, verify if all of the required permissions by the app or the platform are granted.

### 8\. Disable Firewall & Antivirus

 Having a firewall and antivirus installed on a system is the best way to protect your system and important files against malware attacks. However, in some cases, they can also cause video streaming issues by blocking certain connections or links. You can temporarily disable any firewall or antivirus protection on your system and check whether the issue is resolved.

### 9\. Run Windows Built-in Hardware Troubleshooter

 Video streaming issues could sometimes be due to hardware failures like issues with the speaker units or cables or improper configuration settings. In this case, you can run Windows built-in hardware troubleshooter to check if everything is alright and running fine. To run this tool:

* Type**Control Panel** in the search bar and open it.
* Click**Troubleshooting** .

* Click on**View All** .

* Find**Hardware and Devices** in the list and right-click on it.

* Click on**Run as administrator** to start the troubleshooting.

 This tool will check for any hardware-related issues that might be causing a disruption in the video stream and fix them.

### 10\. Clear Browser Cache & Cookies

 Browser cache and cookies are used to store the users’ preferences and make web surfing faster. However, if not cleared regularly, this data can pile up over time, causing the system and the browser to function slowly, ultimately resulting in multiple video streaming errors.

### 11\. Update Browser, Media Player & OS

 An outdated browser, media player or OS could also cause video streaming issues. It is recommended to keep your browser, applications, and OS updated as it not only enhances the user experience but also patches certain bugs that could lead to other issues.

### 12\. Update Graphics Driver

 Graphic drivers in a system ensure that all the graphics-related components are working smoothly. Outdated graphic drivers could cause various graphics-related issues, including video streaming glitches. Updating the graphic drivers to the latest version can solve this issue. To update graphic drivers:

* Press**Win + X** .
* Select**Device Manager** from the list.

* Search for**Display Adapters** and expand it.
* Right-click on the entry under it and click on**Properties** to open it.

* Under the**Driver** tab, click on**Update Driver** .

* Select**Search automatically for drivers** .

### 13\. Other Issues

 Sometimes, video streaming issues are simply the result of a network problem. In such cases, it is best to resolve such issues by contacting your ISP to get the internet back online for uninterrupted video streaming.

### 14\. Repair Corrupt Video Using a Professional Video Repair Tool

A [video file corruption](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/) could be due to bad sectors in your storage media or technical glitches.

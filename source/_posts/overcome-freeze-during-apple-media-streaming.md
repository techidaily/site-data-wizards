> “ _I was watching old videos saved on my Mac. Some of the videos were playing fine, but some did not play. Can someone tell me how to fix this issue?”_

 Apple videos are videos downloaded, created, or recorded on various Apple devices like iPhones, iPads, Macs, etc. These videos are known for their high-definition quality, but sometimes, they fail to play on Windows/ Mac or iPhone/Android.

* Missing or incompatible codecs.
* Media Player glitch or malfunction.
* The smartphone is set to Power-saving mode.
* Cache files occupying lots of storage space on the smartphone.
* Outdated media player.
* Video file corruption.
* Virus or malware infection.
* Interruption during transfer or editing the video.

## **How do you fix Apple videos not playing?**

 Below are a few workarounds you can try to fix: ‘Apple videos not playing’ on iPhone, Android device, Windows, or Mac.

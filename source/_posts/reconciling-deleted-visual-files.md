 We all enjoy using our smartphones or cameras to record videos of our favorite moments, which is why this media-type flaw is so common nowadays.

 Many users kept records of their memorable moments over the years. However, they might unintentionally delete the files. After this, they may make several attempts to recover the files using different techniques, but most of them would fall short of recovering all the lost data.

 But when they finally return the recovered video files, they might discover them damaged or corrupted. Do not be concerned if this happens to you. This article will explain why corruption occurs and show you how to effectively repair recovered video files by various methods, including manual tricks or automated procedures with Stellar Repair for Video.

## Why Do Recovered Video Files Get Corrupted?

 The following list of potential causes should help you determine why the video files become corrupted:

* Despite successfully recovering your videos using data recovery software, they might not play. It happens when something goes wrong during the recovery process.
* An unexpected power outage or lack of internet connectivity can interrupt the data recovery process and result in incomplete data recovery.
* Not employing trustworthy and completely secure data recovery software may corrupt all recoverable files.

 What software then offers complete data consistency and file recovery? Let’s find out!

### 2\. VLC Media Player

 It will first be essential to convert the format. However, the VLC player also has conversion features.

* Download the [**VLC media player**](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) and install it (If you download the portable version, it doesn’t need installation.)
* Open **VLC** , then select **Preferences**  from the **Tools** drop-down menu (You can also access the **Preferences** option by hitting **Ctrl + P** .)

### Conclusion! Bring Back Your Precious Videos

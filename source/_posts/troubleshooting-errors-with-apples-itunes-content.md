### **Use another Media Player**

 You can use VLC Media Player, KMPlayer, QuickTime Player, Windows Media Player, etc., to play your Apple video if it is not working on your regular media player.

### **Update or Reinstall Media Player**

 When Apple videos are not playing on iPhone/Android, try updating or reinstalling the media player app. To do this, visit the Google Play Store or App Store to reinstall or update the app.

 An outdated media player might be the reason why your Apple videos are not playing on Windows/Mac. Update the existing media player on your system to fix this issue.

### **Download the required codecs**

 If a necessary codec is missing or incompatible with your media player, your video may not play on your Windows or Mac.

 So, download the missing codec pack from its authorized website and check if your Apple video plays.

 So, you must close all open applications after using them. Moreover, avoid opening multiple applications at a time. Play your Apple videos after closing all the background applications on your iPhone or Android device.

Turn Mac On and Login First step of course is to make sure your mac is turned on and you have logged in. 2\. Get and Plugin Your Hard Drive You may already have a hard drive or you need to go and buy yourself a hard drive but find a hard drive that is suitable for you to use. Generally a large hard drive is good because you want to be able to store a lot more files onto it. Plug that hard drive into your mac and then format. 3\. Open Up Disk Utility With your hard drive plugged in you now need to go and open up the disk utility. You can access this by going into the finder and into applications or you can also go into the spotlight in the very top right hand corner of your mac and type in disk utility. You'll then have an application that opens up your hard drive. 4\. Drive Format Difference With the hard drive selected click on the arrays area under the area where it says format. You now need to select an appropriate format. The main four formats available are MacOS extended, APFS, Fat32 and Xfat. 5\. Do You Want to Use the Hard Drive on Windows If you're planning on using a windows computer or perhaps sharing some files and folders with your friends and family then you want to be selecting fat32 or xfat. 6\. Label/Name Your Hard Drive Once you've selected your relevant format type, give your usb drive a particular name. 7\. Format the Hard Drive Now you need to format the hard drive by formatting that hard drive. All of the data on that hard drive will be lost so ensure that you do have a backup of that data because once you click format and erase all that data will be deleted. 8\.

Your hard drive will show up on your desktop. You'll actually see the icon show up right there on your desktop. If it doesn't show up you can open up the finder and it will show up in there. You can now copy and paste files directly onto that hard drive. To recover data from a formatted hard drive on Mac you can use Stellar Data Recovery software.

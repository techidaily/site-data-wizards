### #1 Check and fix internet connection

 When you streamline any online video, it may be sluggish, playing in slow motion, or buffer erratically. The problem could be because of a poor internet connection. To fix it, you may test your internet speed using speed checker tools. Make sure that you have an uninterrupted connection while you watch an online video.

 For example: To watch a high-resolution TV show or movie on YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. the minimum internet speed should be at least 1+ Mbps. For smaller online video clips, the speed should be a minimum of 500 kbps. However, to watch Netflix, the internet speed should at least 5Mbps.

 You may also choose Ethernet cable over Wi-Fi, which increases the internet speed and gives you a seamless experience while watching online videos.

 Some users have also reported queries stating – ‘ _My YouTube is slow, but the internet is fast. Still, I’m facing an issue. Please tell me the way to fix it.’_

 In this case, maybe the internet is not the reason behind videos playing slow. It could occur due to other reasons such as outdated graphic drivers, video corruption, etc. If the video is corrupted, you may try an efficient [video repair tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/) to fix all sorts of corruption in the video.

 Cookies, cache files, and temporary files make your system slower and may also impact your browsing experience annoying. If you leave the chrome, firefox, etc browser open for a long time, it may accumulate a huge amount of temporary data, considering visiting multiple websites. To solve this, you may delete the browsing history, cookies, and caches following the given steps:

* Open**Control Panel** and go to**Network and Internet** . (**See Image 1**)

 _Image 1: Go to Control Panel and open Network and Internet_

* Navigate to**Internet Options** and click**Delete browsing history and cookies** . (**See Image 2**)

 _Image 2: Navigate to Internet Options and open Delete browsing history and cookies_

### #3 Reinstall your Browser

 Sometimes, you may encounter videos are playing in slow-motion due to browser incompatibility. Maybe the last version you updated contains some bugs, causing issues with your video lagging, flickering, and other issues. You may uninstall and then reinstall the browser to fix slow-motion videos with the following steps:

* Open**Control Panel** , navigate to**Programs** and click**Uninstall a program. (See Image** **4**)

 _Image 4: Select uninstall a program_

* Now, select your browser from the list of programs, right-click on it, and click**Uninstall** . (**See Image 5**)

 _Image 5: Uninstall your browser_

* Now, visit the official website of the browser and reinstall the latest version.
* Check if the problem is solved.

### #4 Close all applications on PC

 When you try to watch videos on your system and play in slow-motion, it may happen due to several programs running in the background. The videos stored on your system require the computer’s hardware to run seamlessly, especially if you have hardware acceleration enabled. To fix this, you may close all programs and tabs and then try to play the video. Now check if the video is playing properly.

* Open the**Task Manager** and click**End task** to close all the applications on PC. (**See Image 6)**

 _Image 6: Select End task to close the programs_

### #5 Disable hardware acceleration

 Hardware acceleration (if enabled) allows applications, audio cards, and videos stored on your PC to use Windows hardware resources by default. Disabling the hardware acceleration lets the web-based application choose hardware resources requirements rather than PC default settings. The video playing in slow motion error can occur when the PC’s default hardware settings are not enough to play those videos. You may try disabling the acceleration to fix the error. To do so, follow these steps:

* Open**Control Panel > Large Icons View** .
* Click**Display > Change Display Settings** in the left pane.
* Click**Advanced Settings** . If you see the**‘Troubleshooting’** tab in the Advanced Settings, it means that graphics/video card supports hardware acceleration.
* Click**Troubleshooting** and drag the**Hardware Acceleration** slider to**Full** to disable it.
* Click**OK** and restart the system and check if the problem is fixed. (**See Image 7**)

### #6 Update Video Card/Graphics Card driver

 Sometimes, outdated video or graphic drivers maybe another significant reason for videos playing in slow motion on windows 10\. Every video you play on your system is controlled by a video card driver, also known as a graphic card driver. The video card on your system helps in smooth video rendering. Also, it boosts your PC performance. However, outdated or corrupted graphic card drivers may often lead videos to play slowly. It may also cause video lagging, game crash, and other problems.

### #9 Bring Windows to a previous restore point

 Sometimes, the Windows updates may also cause videos playing in slow motion with no sound. You can try to bring Windows to its previous settings via System Restore. Follow the given steps:

 CCTV cameras are indispensable in today’s world where people need to monitor their homes or offices constantly. They help keep your premises safe from theft/ break-in attempts and let you stay vigilant about your assets, kids, pets, etc.

 Popular CCTV cameras like Hikvision, Adiance, Vmukti, Bosch, SimpliCam, Google Nest, etc. are known for their ability to record high-quality video and wide-angle monitoring. These videos are stored locally on the CCTV camera’s SD card or on cloud storage.

 In this blog post, we’ll discuss why CCTV camera videos are not playing on your computer and share ways to repair CCTV footage in different scenarios.

## **Why CCTV Video Footage is Not Playing?**

 There are several reasons why your CCTV video won’t play on Windows or Mac. Some of them are:

**Incompatible Video Format**

 If the CCTV videos transferred from the camera’s SD card are incompatible with your Mac or Windows media player, they may not open or play.

**Unsupported Video Codec**

 Choppy or blurry CCTV videos are caused by an interruption during video transfer from an SD card to the computer, an outdated media player, a corrupt SD card, or corrupt video footage.

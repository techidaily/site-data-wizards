## **Why CCTV Video Footage is Not Playing?**

 There are several reasons why your CCTV video won’t play on Windows or Mac. Some of them are:

**Unsupported Video Codec**

 If your Windows/Mac media player does not support the CCTV videos’ codec, the videos might crash or not play.

**Corrupted Video Footage**

 A corrupt CCTV footage will not work on Mac/Windows. A video footage gets corrupted when the CCTV camera abruptly shuts down while recording.

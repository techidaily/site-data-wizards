 _We purchased the CubeFit TerraMat Standing Desk Mat so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review._

 Standing desk mats are a vital home and workplace accessory if you also own a standing desk. A well-molded one can help relieve pressure on knees and joints, and avoid future back problems. One such desk mat is CubeFit’s TerraMat. Over the course of a week, we used it for a total of 21 hours. We found it to be well-spaced and comfortable, with a design that made it easy to slide under a desk and lots of ways to stay active.

## **Design: Ample room**

 At 30 inches by 27 inches by 2.5 inches (LWH), the Ergomat is a large desk mat, allowing ample space for you to spread out and move around. The mat looks flat with some knobs and bars, but in reality, it has massage mounds, pressure peaks, power wedges, support tracks, and a balance bar. In adding these features, the mat allows eleven different positions in which to stand and stretch.

 The TerraMat was designed to maximize the desk workout without stepping away from your work.

## **Comfort: Great small perks**

 The TerraMat was designed to maximize the desk workout without stepping away from your work. When we began to test it, we were surprised by the mat’s firmness. Most mats are somewhat plush and squishy, but the TerraMat wasn’t. As we used it, however, we realized that our feet didn’t ache so long as we kept utilizing the various features on this particular mat.

 The bottom of the mat lacks any adhesives, yet we noticed the mat didn’t want to move across carpeted surfaces.

 That’s the trick to this mat—making sure to stay active while using it. When we first opened it, it came with a handy card linking to the[company website](https://getcubefit.com/) where you can get tips and ideas to remain active. The website demonstrates nine different ways to you can work out your legs. We tested each out and were pleased to feel our muscles working as we tried the calf raises or hamstring stretch exercise at our standing desk. Another perk is that if you turn it around, you get more positions and stretches to work your legs, core, and balance.

 The bottom of the mat lacks any adhesives, yet we noticed the mat didn’t want to move across carpeted surfaces. It moved more smoothly across tiles, but not enough that if we stepped on it, it would slide out from under our feet.

 We especially liked the extra stretching features such as the balance beam to strengthen the core.

 We recommend you don’t use the TerraMat with high heels and unstable shoes. Such directions make sense. After all, the mat was designed for low-soled shoes and bare feet. We highly recommend giving the pressure peaks a try sans shoes since using it while wearing heels defeats the purpose of having a mat that can stretch leg muscles. We also noticed that the TerraMat shows dirt rather easily. It’s simple to spot clean it (simply use a wet paper towel and the marks go away), but wear and tear will be noticeable as time goes on.

## **Price: Perfect for the basics**

 At around $90 on Amazon, the TerraMat is one of the priciest standing desk mats out on the market. However, factoring in the various activities you can do and the sturdy surface, the price feels more reasonable.

## **CubeFit TerraMat vs. Ergohead Standing Desk Mat**

 We decided to compare the TerraMat against the Ergohead for two reasons: price and the various surface features. In terms of price, the TerraMat and the Ergohead are very similar. The TerraMat retails for around $90, while the Ergohead will cost around $80\.

 They begin differentiating at the mat thickness. The Ergohead is slightly thicker than the TerraMat, which gives it a plusher sensation on the feet. However, this also means that the features of the Ergohead—the massage mounds and the power wedges—are also plusher. If you would prefer firmer features, we recommend going with the TerraMat. However, if you would prefer a cushier mat, the Ergohead is best for you.

 One more important thing to note is that while the TerraMat remains firmly attached to the ground, the Ergohead does not. While this makes it easy to slide under a desk, on non-carpeted surfaces, the Ergohead can also make stepping onto and off the mat very slick. If you would prefer a firmer floor grip, the TerraMat is definitely the safer choice.

 Final Verdict

 **Great for the office despite the high price.**

 Overall, the CubeFit TerraMat is a really nice mat capable of working out the lower body without overdoing it. We especially liked the extra stretching features such as the balance beam to strengthen the core. Despite the relatively high price, the TerraMat is a solid investment for any office.

## **Solution 1: Play the video in another media player**

 As the video error code 0xc10100be can occur due to an unsupported codec, you may try changing your media player. The default Windows Media Player or QuickTime Player may not support the video file format or its codec.

 You can try **[VLC Media Player which plays popular video files](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/) ,** such as MP4, AVI, MOV, 3GP, FLV, etc.

 There are many other players such as Winamp, KMPlayer, MXPlayer, Elmedia Player, etc., which you can use.

 A video won’t play unless you have the right codec installed on your system. In the absence of the required codec, the video might throw error code 0xc10100be.

 You can search online for the codec of your video file type and download it.

 If you are using Windows Media Player 11, it has the provision to download codecs automatically. If you are not sure which codec to download, get a codec pack such as K-Lite. A video codec pack lets you play almost any video file type.

### **Steps to download video codecs in Windows Media Player:**

1. Open Windows Media Player 11.
2. Go to **Tools** \> **Options > Player.**
3. Select the **Download codecs automatically** checkbox, and click **OK.**
4. Next, play the error-giving video. If it prompts to install the codec, click **Install** .

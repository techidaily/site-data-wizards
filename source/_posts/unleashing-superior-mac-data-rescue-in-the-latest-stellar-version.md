![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/boxshot/Stellar-Data-Recovery-Professional-for-Windows.png) **Houston** **,** **Texas** **, March 6, 2024:** Stellar®, a global data care leader, announced the launch of the 12th version of its flagship [Mac Data Recovery software](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/) . The new release boasts of improved features to enable faster and smoother data recovery. The highlight of the present version is an all-new, modern and flexible user interface supporting personalized themes for mac users.

 The new version brings improved data recovery results for files, folders, documents, e-mails, photos, music & other important data across diverse data loss scenarios including accidental deletion, drive formatting, system crash, unrecognized volume etc. It can quickly recover data from FileVault encrypted storage devices, emptied 'Trash,' encrypted APFS partitions along with support for 4k drive.

 A number of user-friendly features have been added to the software for enabling easy retrieval of data. The users can preview and easily access data with the help of 'On-the-Fly' creation of Classic tree and File Type tree during a scan. With the new "pause and resume" scan, they can pause a scan, save the recoverable files and resume the scan.

 The 12th release is fully compatible and optimized for the latest macOS Sonoma 14.0 edition. Additionally, it can run on Mac devices powered by the latest Apple M3 chip without the need to disable the SIP or add the KEXT. The release also supports fragmented MOV & MP4 video recovery for removable thumb drives and memory cards.

 In addition to data recovery, multimedia repair functionalities have been refined in the latest release. The improved in-built photo and video repair utilities are available with the Premium and Technician editions. The [Technician edition](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/) is also equipped with newly-added, advanced file recovery capabilities.

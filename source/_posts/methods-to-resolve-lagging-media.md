## **Workarounds to Fix the Problem of Can’t Play Recorded Videos**

 Here are some common solutions to fix the**‘Can’t Play Recorded Videos’** issue on Windows/Mac. We recommend trying each method one by one.

### **Restart the Media Player or PC**

 The most basic step is when your iPhone recorded videos are not playing on the existing media player of your Mac or Windows PC, restart the media player and try to play the video. If this doesn’t work, close all the applications and restart your Mac or Windows PC.

### **Use another Media Player**

 If your screen-recorded video is not playing on Windows/ Mac due to a missing codec, try to play your video on another media player.

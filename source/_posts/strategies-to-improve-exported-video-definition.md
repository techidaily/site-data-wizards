 Saving and sharing edited videos online, email, PC, DVD or other external drive has become easier with advanced video editing tools. But these are not devoid of numerous complaints about video quality loss after exporting to a medium. If you are also facing the loss of video quality and saturation after exporting from video editing software, this post guides you to the several workarounds to fix the issue.

## **So, why does your video lose its quality after export and how can this be fixed?**

 There can be many reasons for the issue from the old graphic driver not supporting file formats to absence of compatible codecs. You might have used wrong export settings combination or a certain special effect that lead to the quality loss in videos after export. Based on the probable reason, apply the below fixes to resolve quality loss issue in videos after export:

### **Way 1: Restart your PC and export again**

 Sometimes due to system conflicts, the video export could fail. Try to**e** xport your video again after restarting your system. Your exported video might play well without any quality issues after restarting.

### **Way 2: Try to play your video in another media player**

 It is possible that the player you are using does not support the file type or the codec that was used to compress the exported video file. Try playing video in another media player, such as VLC Player, Windows Media Player, PotPlayer, etc. A widely used VLC Player usually plays videos not played by other players. It comes with its own internal codecs and plays just any video format. This free and open source player is compatible with all Mac, Windows and Linux platforms.

### **Way 3: Remove special effect and export**

 Sometimes rendering through third-party plugins can cause problem on export. Try exporting video without special effects. Select a video clip with effects, make a copy of its timeline, and remove all effects in that timeline and then export your video.

### **Way 4: Check your systemâ€™s specifications**

 Your system should be powerful enough to save your heavy rendered videos. Ensure sufficient memory space, CPU, and GPU to save large videos or movies.

### **Way 5: Customize your export settings**

 Ensure the export settings in timeline is according to the source video clip quality and format. This is important to get the good video quality after export. Every video editing software has provision of recommended settings and advanced settings. Customize and apply the settings as per your requirement. Re-export your video in right size to prevent blurred, jerky or shaky videos and improve video quality. Select resolution, dimension, aspect ratio, bit rate etc., based on the format, size, and frame rate. Always preview the video before exporting to be rest assured of the final output.

 The settings also vary with the purpose of the video, whether you want to upload it on YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram, or just use for archiving.  
 For instance, YouTube videos work at standard settings of 1280x720p HD and 1920x1080p HD in a 16:9 aspect ratio. If you set the aspect ratio to something very less than 16:9, vertical black bars on left and right sides of the video display will appear. On the other hand, unlike YouTube, the Facebook video is not limited to 16:9 aspect ratio but the video size should not exceed 4GB. Its recommended format is H.264, and resolution may vary with 720p or 1080p. While for Instagram the MP4 is the preferred format with H.264 codec, 3500 kbps bitrate.

### **Way 7: Change the codec**

 The broken or truncated video might be due to the incompatible codec of the file format or absence of correct codec in your system. Thus, try exporting your video with a different codec. The preferred way is to first repair video codec issue using VLC Media Player. Open your video in VLC Player. Go to**Tools** \>**Preference** \> Click on**Input & Codecs > Always Fix** \>**Save** . Now view your video, if the quality issue is fixed.

 If the problem persists, install a codec pack or a single codec for your specific video file format.

### **Way 8: Try increasing the bit rate of your video**

 A video file quality is measured by bit rate. Higher the bit rate, better the quality. Try re-export your video with the higher bit rate settings.

 Usually, the acceptable setting combination is a bit rate 3000 kbps with compression format of H.264, and dimension 1280Ã—720\. Try to keep your videos in the range of 3000-5000 kbps bit rate. You can check your videoâ€™s _bit rate through any_ media player. For VLC Player, open the video, go to**Tools** and select _**Media Information**_ . If you are using Quicktime, press command-I to view bit rate information.

| **Tip:** For good quality videos to be shared on social media work at 1080px video with a 30fps frame rate, 16:9 aspect ratio and file format to a H.264\. This is irrespective of the camera you are using, whether GoPro, Canon DSLR, Panasonic, Nikon, etc. |

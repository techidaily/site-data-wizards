## How Do I Repair Recovered Corrupt Video Files?

### 1\. Stellar Repair for Video

 Your first choice for fixing the “**recovered video files not playing** ” problem should be a well-designed, safe, and secure video repair software. The only software with these qualities in the market is Stellar Repair for Video. Stellar Repair for Video fixes problems with the file headers or formats and fixes files you can’t play.

 Plus, it corrects issues with playback, such as unplayable, stuttering, flickering, black screens, out-of-sync, choppy, jerky, truncated, grainy, frozen, blurred, and other issues. In other words, it is a comprehensive restoration tool that will eliminate the need for many supplementary programs to restore a video.

 Another point that we should highlight is how simple the repair procedure is. You can complete it without expert assistance in under a minute. Other programs, like VLC media player, mentioned in the article, are difficult to use and have a confusing user interface, making it easy for users to become lost in the settings while trying to fix videos.

* Open **VLC** , then select **Preferences**  from the **Tools** drop-down menu (You can also access the **Preferences** option by hitting **Ctrl + P** .)

### 3\. Update Drivers

 The Graphics card and driver are responsible for video playbacks and displaying other media on the screen. You can update your drivers by following the steps below.

* Right-click on the**Start Menu** and select**Device Manager** from the list.

* Select the**Display Adapter** to expand the category.
* Update the driver by right-clicking on the**Graphic Card** and selecting the**Update** option.

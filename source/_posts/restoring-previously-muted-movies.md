This article will explain why corruption occurs and show you how to effectively repair recovered video files by various methods, including manual tricks or automated procedures with Stellar Repair for Video.

## Why Do Recovered Video Files Get Corrupted?

 The following list of potential causes should help you determine why the video files become corrupted:

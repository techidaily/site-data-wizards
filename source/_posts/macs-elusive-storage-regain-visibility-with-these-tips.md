 External hard drive not showing up on Mac is one of the biggest nightmares a MacBook Pro, Air, iMac, or Mac mini user might have come across. And often asked why is my external hard drive not showing up in mac? Fortunately, this video has collaborated on 8 ways to fix external hard drive not showing up problems in Mac. Time Stamps: 00:00 Introduction 00:41 Show drive within Finder preferences 00:57 Reboot your Mac 01:08 Try another USB port or different USB cable 01:41 Try another Mac or PC 02:07 Does it show up in Terminal? 03:10 Mount drive within Disk Utility 03:53 Update USB device drivers 04:51 Use Stellar Data Recovery At 00:41, navigate to the Finder and select the hard drive, external hard drive option. If this worked for you great, give us a thumbs up; otherwise, apply the following methods. At 00:57, The Second methods suggest you restart your Mac computer or laptop. A simple reboot can solve this issue, considering the storage media was affected by a minor system error. But as mentioned, if the external hard drive has a problem that needs attention at a higher level, try our Third method to fix the external hard drive not showing Mac, i.e., at 01:08; we suggest you use another USB port or connect the external hard drive using a different cable. Linking to another USB and using a different cable helps resolve this problem instantly. But, sometimes, your USB or the storage device doesn't get recognized due to the latest macOS version or a new MacBook system. Don't worry; connect the storage drive hardware to another Mac system running the same macOS or an earlier version. You may also plug in your external hard drive into a Windows PC 01:41\. As we advanced, we took help from the Terminal utility to determine if our external hard drive has physical or logical damage. At 02:07, launch the Terminal app and type the command diskutil list. This command will show up all the connected devices on your Mac. The best thing about this command is that even if your drive is corrupt logically, the chances of getting listed in the Terminal diskutil list command are very high. So, don't forget this step. This assures that your USB isn't damaged physically and can be recovered further. After taking the help from the Terminal, we move forward to the Disk Utility app at 03:10\. Launch the Disk Utility and verify if the unmounted external hard drive is showing up in the left pane of the Disk Utility? Select the greyed-out storage device and press the Mount button to force it to mount on Mac. Now, this may or may not work depending on the corruption of the media. But remember this, if you accidentally unmounted the USB device, this method will work 100% in your favor. The external hard drive not showing on Mac may also arise if the device drivers aren't updated as per the system or the hardware of the macOS computers. At 03:53 Better lookout for drivers information from the manufacturer of your storage drive. But what if none of the solutions worked for you and your files are at risk of loss? Caution, never erase your greyed-out external hard drive with the Disk Utility. Doing so will bring your hard drive back, but it will erase all the files and folders from your external hard drive. Wondering what the optimal solution for data recovery from umounted external hard drive or USB is? At 04:51, we recommend that users who face this problem use Stellar Data Recovery Free Edition on the Mac system. Select, and Scan the unmounted drive with Stellar and retrieve up to 1 Gb of files for free.

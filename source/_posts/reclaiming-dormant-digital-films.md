## How Do I Repair Recovered Corrupt Video Files?

### 1\. Stellar Repair for Video

 Your first choice for fixing the “**recovered video files not playing** ” problem should be a well-designed, safe, and secure video repair software. The only software with these qualities in the market is Stellar Repair for Video. Stellar Repair for Video fixes problems with the file headers or formats and fixes files you can’t play.

 Plus, it corrects issues with playback, such as unplayable, stuttering, flickering, black screens, out-of-sync, choppy, jerky, truncated, grainy, frozen, blurred, and other issues. In other words, it is a comprehensive restoration tool that will eliminate the need for many supplementary programs to restore a video.

 Another point that we should highlight is how simple the repair procedure is. You can complete it without expert assistance in under a minute. Other programs, like VLC media player, mentioned in the article, are difficult to use and have a confusing user interface, making it easy for users to become lost in the settings while trying to fix videos.

 Ultimately, it is compatible with most media capture equipment, including Sony cameras, CCTV, and security cameras. This feature makes it the perfect choice for store or supermarket owners and professional photographers and videographers.

Here’s how to utilize the application:

* First, download and install [**Stellar Repair for Video**](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/) from the official website.

* After the process, you can preview the repaired file or run the **Advanced Repair** process.

* Finally, click on **Save Repaired Files** to save the video files.

* If you select **Advanced Repair,** a window will appear asking for a video sample. The video sample needs to be recorded by the same media capture device with which you captured the damaged video. Choose **Next** .

* Click **Browse** , then choose the necessary **Sample**  file from the list of options. Finally, select **Apply** to use the sample file you’ve chosen to fix all the corrupt video files in the list by applying it to all files with the same format.

* After you’ve added the sample video, click the **Repair** button. A dialog window titled **Repair process completed** displays after the process. Click **OK** .

* Click **Save Repaired Files** . A dialog box appears with options to save repaired files at the source or a different location if you want to save the file somewhere else.

### 2\. VLC Media Player

 The VLC video player provides an automated repair process to fix video files. But it only fixes faulty or damaged AVI-formatted videos.

 It will first be essential to convert the format. However, the VLC player also has conversion features.

* Download the [**VLC media player**](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) and install it (If you download the portable version, it doesn’t need installation.)
* Open **VLC** , then select **Preferences**  from the **Tools** drop-down menu (You can also access the **Preferences** option by hitting **Ctrl + P** .)

* Select the**Display Adapter** to expand the category.
* Update the driver by right-clicking on the**Graphic Card** and selecting the**Update** option.

### Conclusion! Bring Back Your Precious Videos

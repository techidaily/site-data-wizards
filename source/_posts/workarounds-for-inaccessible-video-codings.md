 It’s annoying to receive unsupported video codec or format errors as they don’t let you play videos.

 ‘ _Missing codec. An item was encoded in a format that’s not supported.’_

 _‘Windows Media Player cannot play the file because the required video codec is not installed on your computer.’_

 _‘A codec is required to play this file.’_

_‘Invalid File Format.’_

_An error occurred. Unsupported file format.’_

 You can get such error messages when trying to play a video on PC, Mac, Smart TV, Android or other devices. Unsupported format errors are also reported while trying to open a file in video editing tools.

## Why does unsupported codec or format error occur?

 The error as obvious with the messages, appears due to absence of a codec that is required to play the video file on your computer or smartphone.

 Technically, a video file comprises a codec and a container. A container is the file format that contains the file metadata while codec is required to encode or decode the video data.

 So if your media player or device doesn’t support the video format or codec, it won’t play the video file.

 Other than lack of supporting codec, the invalid file format error may also appear when the video file is corrupt.

## How to fix an unsupported video codec error?

 There are various ways to deal with the unsupported format problem in videos.

 Either convert the file format to one that is supported by your media player or change the player itself. You can also consider installing the supporting codec on your system to play the video s.

 **Below are the methods to fix unsupported codec error and play the videos on your device in any media player:**

## Method 1: Play video in a different media player

 Not every media player supports all video file formats. For instance, QuickTime Player only supports MOV, MPEG, some AVI, and WAV files. It cannot play other formats such as AVCHD, MKV or WEBM, etc.

 Similarly, Windows Media Player won’t play FLV or FLAC files due to absence of their codecs.

 If videos are giving codec error in one media player, try with another. May be the default media player of your device doesn’t support the video file format.

 Get VLC Media Player to fix video codec error on Android, Mac or Windows. The player is compatible with most file formats including MP4, AVI, MKV, MOV, AVCHD, etc. You can even watch DVD movies on VLC Player.

 There are many free open source multimedia players. Try 5K Player, PotPlayer, Winamp, KMPlayer, Roxio Popcorn, and others.

 Also, you can search online, which media players support your video file format and install that on your system.

 If video file gives unsupported codec error on Mac, right-click on the file. Click on**‘Open With’** option. Mac may suggest all the installed apps that can play the video.

## Method 2: Download the missing video codecs

 If the ‘video codec is not supported’ error appears on Windows or Mac, then download the codec.

 Search the web for the supported codec of your video file type to install the right codec.

 Another option is to install a complete codec pack such as K-Lite for Windows and Perian for Mac. A codec pack extends support for the default media player on your system. A pack would contain codec for almost all file formats.

 However, be aware that there may be malicious ads for codec downloads. This can put your computer at risk. Make sure you download codecs from a trusted source, preferably from the manufacturer’s site.

 Some players such as Windows Media player and VLC also have the provision for automatic download of codecs. You can try that as well.

### **Steps to fix video codec not supported in Windows Media Player:**

* Open Windows Media Player.
* Go to**Tools** \> **Options.**
* **Click on Player tab.**
* Select the **Download codecs automatically** check box and make sure you have a continuous internet connection.
* Click **OK.**
* **Next, play your video** file in the player. A message will prompt to install codec.
* Click **Install.**

### **Steps to download codec in VLC Player**

* Open VLC Media Player.
* Click**Help >> Check for Updates** .

* Click**Yes.** This will automatically download the new codecs also.

## Method 3: Convert the video file format

 If you don’t want to install a new codec or codec pack, there is another option.

 Convert the file format of your video that is showing unsupported codec error. Choose a different format that is compatible with your player. Usually MP4, MOV, and AVI files are playable in all media players and video editing software.

 You can convert a video file format using a desktop converter such as Stellar Converter for Audio Video or via any secure online video converter program.

 The open source VLC Media Player can also convert video files to different format.

### **Steps to convert video in VLC to fix unsupported codec problems:**

* Go to **Media.**
* Select **Convert/Save** .
* Click **Add** and select the video to be repaired.

* In the**Convert** window, select new video file format from the**Profile** options. You can also click on**Edit Selected Profile** (wrench icon) to edit a specific profile.
* Once done, click **Start** to convert the video file.

### **Convert video file to fix unsupported codec error on Android**

 Android phones can usually play MP4 and 3GP videos of H.263 or H.264 format. So you can convert videos to either one to play on your smartphone.

### **Convert file to fix codec not supported error on Smart TV**

 If you are receiving the codec error on Smart TV when trying to play a video, first transfer the file to your laptop. Next, fix codec issue by converting the video file to a format supported by your Smart TV. You can use any of the above conversion method.

### **Wrapping up**

 Playing a video in another media player, downloading supporting codecs or converting the file format can help to fix ‘unsupported video format’ error on Windows, Mac or Android.

### **Restart your Device & Media Player**

 If your Apple video is not playing on iPhone/Android or Mac/Windows, close all applications and restart your device.

 You can even try to close the media player and then launch it again to see if the video is working. If this doesn’t work, move to the next method.

### **Use another Media Player**

### **Update or Reinstall Media Player**

 When Apple videos are not playing on iPhone/Android, try updating or reinstalling the media player app. To do this, visit the Google Play Store or App Store to reinstall or update the app.

 An outdated media player might be the reason why your Apple videos are not playing on Windows/Mac. Update the existing media player on your system to fix this issue.

### **Download the required codecs**

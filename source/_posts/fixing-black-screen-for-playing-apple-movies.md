### **Clear Cache Files**

 Accumulation of cache and temp files also affects the performance of your Windows/Mac or smartphones. So clear the cache files of your device to fix this problem.

 If Apple videos are not playing on your PC or Mac, clear the cache and temp files from your system. Likewise, clear the cache data of the Android/iPhone so that your device works smoothly and your videos are running fine.

 In this video we're going to be covering how to fix a kernel panic that has occurred on your Mac. A kernel panic is a sign of a fatal error that has occurred on your mac and could potentially lead to data loss. The causes of kernel panics could be very vast. They could be either: a) Software related b) Hardware related Software could be something on your macOS, it could be an application that is installed or downloaded from somewhere or it could be something on the hardware. It could be your hard drive itself, it could be RAM, it could be the motherboard or logic board inside of the computer or something not playing well or failing or having an interference with something else could be one of the reasons that a kernel panic occurs. It really depends on the severity of the kernel panic but sometimes just a simple reboot of your mac could get your mac starting up again so having one kernel panic is not a massive issue especially if you can reboot it and it's fine but if it happens more than once, be careful. We would recommend backing up all of your data if it happens regularly. You're going to need to go and get some advice because you may get one fatal kernel panic that you will not be able to recover from. There are a couple of screens that you just want to be aware of if you are encountering some sort of a kernel panic, it could be like a white screen or a gray screen. Steps to fix Kernel Panic on Mac: 00:00 Introduction 01:35 Step 1- Boot Mac into Safe Mode 02:03 Step 2 - Reset NVRAM/PRAM 02:28 Step 3 - Use the Disk Utility 03:40 Step 4 - Reinstall macOS 04:20 Step 5 - Create a Recovery Disk Get Stellar Dara Recovery Free Edition\* software: <https://www.stellarinfo.com/free-mac-data-recovery.php> \*The free edition version can recover up to 1GB data totally free of cost. So, now you know a little bit more about kernel panic, why it happens and what steps you can be trying but as said at the very start if this is something that is occurring regularly we would recommend getting some expert advice because it could lead to a more catastrophic failure. #MacKernelPanic #HowToFixKernelPanic #KernelPanicError Thank you so much for spending the time and watching this video.

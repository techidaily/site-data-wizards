### **5\. Reduce the Video Size and Resolution**

 Try reducing the size and resolution of choppy video and then play it. This might work in case of high-resolution videos. For instance, if the video’s resolution is 1080p 30fps, reduce it to 720p resolution. Your system will have to work less in playing the low resolution video file.

**How to reduce video size to smooth play choppy video**

 Compress the video file or resize it by trimming some video segments. You can use video compressor applications available for Android, PC or Mac.

 Commonly used, VLC Media Player can also compress videos. To trim video segments and reduce resolution, frame rate, or bitrate**Stellar Converter for Audio Video** is a good option. The software is available for Windows and Mac.

 For online videos such as YouTube or Vimeo, you can lower the video quality by going into the video settings option.

1. Go to**Device Manager** and expand ‘**Sound, video and game controller’.**
2. Locate the device that you want to update, right-click on the device name, and select ‘**Update Driver Software’.**

 If the problem still persists, then try to increase the system’s RAM or CPU capacity to enhance its overall performance and make your hardware more powerful.

### **7\. Check Your Computer Configuration**

 Is your computer equipped enough to play high quality HD, UHD, or Full HD videos? Before playing the videos, ensure that your computer meets the minimum system requirements. To play videos with higher resolution (1080p 60 fps and higher), it is recommended to have at least 3.0 – 3.7 GHz of processors, at least 6 GB RAM with a robust video card (GeForce GT 650M).

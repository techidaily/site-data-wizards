 CCTV cameras are indispensable in today’s world where people need to monitor their homes or offices constantly. They help keep your premises safe from theft/ break-in attempts and let you stay vigilant about your assets, kids, pets, etc.

 Popular CCTV cameras like Hikvision, Adiance, Vmukti, Bosch, SimpliCam, Google Nest, etc. are known for their ability to record high-quality video and wide-angle monitoring. These videos are stored locally on the CCTV camera’s SD card or on cloud storage.

 A corrupt CCTV footage will not work on Mac/Windows. A video footage gets corrupted when the CCTV camera abruptly shuts down while recording.

 CCTV videos not opening or playing can be frustrating when you need to watch a recorded video urgently to retrieve a lost asset or review a past event. Here are some common CCTV videos not working scenarios and how to solve them.

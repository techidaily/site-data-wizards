 MOV video file format, developed by Apple, is a popular format for editing and distributing videos. It is an MPEG 4 video container file, usually played by the built-in QuickTime player on Mac.

 A MOV file is a multimedia container that can store video, audio, and text –in the same file on different tracks. These files contain high bitrate videos with little to no compression resulting in a substantial file size. Since MOV files offer high-quality videos, they are the preferred choice of professional media editors.

 _“I recorded a movie in iMovie and transferred it from my iPhone to Mac. While transferring it to Mac, the process was interrupted due to low battery._

 _Now the video is not opening in the QuickTime Player. iPhone, too, doesn’t have the video, as I deleted it after copying it to Mac. I tried a couple of video repair tools to repair my MOV video, but they didn’t work. Can someone tell me the best software to repair corrupted MOV video files on Mac?”_

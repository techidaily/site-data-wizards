 **Solution 2: Download H.265 video codecs**

 HEVC video playback problems are mostly due to absence of right codecs. You may receive error messages such as ‘_A codec is required to play this file’_ or_‘Media Player encountered an error’_ and so on.

 So install x265 codecs on your system, to play H.265/ HEVC compression format or get a Media Player Codec Pack that contains x265 codecs.

### **Solution 3: Convert H.265 to H.264 format**

 HEVC or H.265 video not playing on PC, Mac, Android? Simply convert the file format, preferably to H.264.

 Although, this may initially seem a bad idea as you may not want to compromise with the superior video quality. However, there are reasons to convert the format when the HEVC or H.265 video is not playing on your device.

 First, the high quality HEVC videos are processor intensive. They can either slow your computer or the video may play choppy.

 Second, the default media player of your device may not have support for H.265 videos. Thus, HEVC videos may show error.

 So, if you want to simply watch the video, store or transfer the HEVC file, convert the file format. But if considering HEVC video files for editing, then you can skip this option.

 You can convert HEVC H.265 files to H.264 MP4, MKV, MOV, 3GP, AVI, etc.

 Search for free online H.265 video converters, if there are a few files to convert. Make sure you are using a secure online video converter site, free from virus or malware. You may try Convertio, AnyConv etc.

 Desktop HEVC video converters are more secure. H.265 file converters such as **[Stellar Converter for Audio Video](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/)**  are quick and efficient. They allow you convert unlimited number of videos to different formats.

 _**Tip:**  Close all other tasks when trying to play H.265 video as the format is CPU consuming and your system may not be able to process it._

### **Solution 4: Use a HEVC supporting video player**

 Don’t want to convert the H.265 video format or get x265 codecs, then change your media player. Your media player may not support HEVC videos. So play H.265 video in a different one. Try File Viewer Plus, 5K Player, Blu-Ray Player, VLC Player or others.

#### **HEVC files not playing in VLC Media Player**

 VLC Player has the support for H.265 format. But often users complain, VLC doesn’t open HEVC videos, plays the file choppy with no audio. To fix HEVC files not playing in VLC, get the latest version of the player.

#### **HEVC files not playing in Android phone**

 Apple devices like iPhone, already support HEVC video files. But to play H.265 videos on Android device, you need to download HEVC supporting media player. You can try MX Player, VPlayer, FVPlayer or others to play H.265 videos on Android.

### **To Sum Up**

 Very few media players and devices have adopted H.265 format. Thus, several video playback issues are related to format incompatibility. Getting the right codecs, converting file format or changing the media player can help to play H.265 videos in such cases.

 However, if these methods don’t work, it points to corruption in the HEVC file. Stellar Repair for Video is a secure software that can fix corrupted H.265 videos and bring them back to pristine form.

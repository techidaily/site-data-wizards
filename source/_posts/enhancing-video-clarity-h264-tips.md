## **Why your H.264 MOV files turn corrupt?**

 H.264 is a popular video compression format used by DSLRs, digital cameras, drones and many surveillance cameras. These high-quality video files stored in computer, SD card, pen drive, external hard drive etc., may get corrupt due to various reasons like virus infection, corruption in the storage drive, interruption while downloading/ transfer etc.

 The corrupt video often shows errors, stops after playing for some time, throws black screen, loses sound, flickers, gets choppy, broken, or may not play at all.

## **How to repair corrupt H.264 MOV videos**

 A video repair tool is the only solution to repair corruption in H.264 video files. An efficient repair software can fix choppy, jerky, grainy, broken, and truncated videos.

 However, it is not essential that all jerky, slow, or not playing videos are corrupt.

 The H.264 video issues may also arise due to incompatible codecs, unsupported media player or outdated PC drivers. To rule out these factors, begin with few workarounds that may play your H.264 MOV files smoothly again.

## **Workarounds to play your H.264 MOV files**

### **1\. Play the video in another media player**

 If H.264 MOV video is not playing properly in one player, try another supporting one like VLC Media Player, 5KPlayer, PotPlayer, QuickTime etc.

### **2\. Download the MOV supporting codec**

 The MOV video won’t play if the required codecs are not installed on your computer. You can install a codec pack online or configure Windows Media Player to download codecs automatically.

 To get MOV supporting codec in Windows Media Player, go to**Tools >** **Options** \> **Player.** Check in**Download codecs automatically** and click **OK** . Now, try to play the file. If you are prompted to install the codec, click **Install** .

### **3\. Convert the video file to another format**

 Apart from online video converter tools, VLC Player can also convert H.264 videos to MP4 or AVI etc.

**Steps to convert H.264 MOV videos to MP4 in VLC Media Player:**

* Open VLC and click **Media >** **Convert/Save**

![Steps to convert H.264 MOV videos to MP4 in VLC Media Player](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/1-1.png)

* In the Open Media window, click on **Add** to select the MOV videos you want to convert

![Open Media window, click on Addto select the MOV videos](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2-1.png)

* Click on **Convert/Save** at the bottom
* In the **Convert** box, select the destination folder and the name for the new video file.
* Under **Profile** , select the file format you want to convert to
* Click **Start** to convert

### **4\. Update your PC video drivers**

 Updates fix issues related to video drivers. Windows driver updates are automatically downloaded with Windows Update. Go to**Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update** \> **Check for updates.**

### **5.** **Try Reducing the Screen Resolution**

 By reducing the screen resolution, you can understand whether it’s a faulty graphics driver or there is a problem with the video itself.

### **6\. Turn Off hardware acceleration**

 Sometimes the problems could be due to hardware acceleration. When enabled, hardware acceleration passes graphical intensive tasks within the browser to make it perform better.

To disable hardware acceleration in Google Chrome, follow these steps:

1. On the Chrome toolbar, click Settings > Advanced
2. Under System, toggle-off the Use hardware acceleration when available option

 If your H.264 videos don’t play properly, after the above workarounds, they are corrupt. Use a H.264 video repair application to fix the problem.

1. Repair video with VLC Media Player
2. Use Stellar Repair for Video

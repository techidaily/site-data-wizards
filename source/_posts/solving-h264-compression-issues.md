## **Why your H.264 MOV files turn corrupt?**

 H.264 is a popular video compression format used by DSLRs, digital cameras, drones and many surveillance cameras. These high-quality video files stored in computer, SD card, pen drive, external hard drive etc., may get corrupt due to various reasons like virus infection, corruption in the storage drive, interruption while downloading/ transfer etc.

 The corrupt video often shows errors, stops after playing for some time, throws black screen, loses sound, flickers, gets choppy, broken, or may not play at all.

## **How to repair corrupt H.264 MOV videos**

 A video repair tool is the only solution to repair corruption in H.264 video files. An efficient repair software can fix choppy, jerky, grainy, broken, and truncated videos.

[The software is taking a long time to complete the scan. How long will it take to scan my hard drive?](#collapse3)

 The time required to scan your drive depends on factors, like the storage capacity, drive condition, data loss situation (for example, simple deletion vs formatting), etc.

 The software may take longer scan duration due to reasons like,

* Large disk volume
* Bad sectors on the drive
* Disk fragmentation
* Interface connectivity issues
* Power supply issues

Here are some quick tips to speed up the drive scanning

* You can choose to recover specific files instead of the complete data at one go.
* You can create a hard drive ‘image’ using Stellar Data Recovery Professional tool and then scan the image for faster turnaround.
* You can choose Quick Scan for simple data loss scenarios like deletion.

[I have recovered the files. However, they are not opening. What do I do?](#collapse4)

 You may be unable to open a recovered file or the files may show up in 0 KB size after recovery. This may happen due to the following reasons:

* You recovered the files from a previously-scanned image of the drive, saved a few days or weeks ago
* The files were already overwritten with new data before you recovered them.
* You lack the Admin rights, the drive is encrypted, or read/write protection is enabled on the device.

 In this situation, we recommend performing a fresh scan on the drive and check the recovery results.

[My hard drive is encrypted by a ransomware. How do I recover the files or decrypt them?](#collapse5)

 There is a vast variety of ransomware which use different mechanisms to encrypt and sometimes also delete the files. In this situation, you can scan the drive using Stellar Data Recovery Professional software to try and recover the deleted files. However, we recommend reaching out to a data recovery expert to get professional help on ransomware data recovery.

[How to Resolve Automapping Issue While Exporting Mailboxes to Office 365?](#collapse6)

 You may receive an Automap error while exporting mailboxes to Office 365 by using**Stellar Repair for Exchange** or**Stellar Converter for EDB** software. The error can occur due to Admin Rights Issue and when Automapping is set to False.

 Also, even if we provide Admin rights to any user with Automapping False, the user will not be visible via Configured Outlook Admin profile. In such a case, the users will fail to export the data.

 Apply following solution to fix the issue and export mailboxes to Office 365,

* User account on which you want to export the data should have Admin rights with Automapping ‘True’.
* Ensure the user is present in GAL (Global Address Book)

 You can provide the Admin rights to the user(s) by using_Powershell commands._ For example, to add full access permissions for an administrator to John Smith's mailbox, type the following command, and then press**Enter** ,  
  
 Add-MailboxPermission -Identity [johnsmith@contoso.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:johnsmith@contoso.onmicrosoft.com) \-User [admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com) \-AccessRights FullAccess -AutoMapping $true

 Once done you need to configure the outlook profile again with office 365 admin account. Which will then start showing all the delegated mailboxes in the outlook profile. Now, you can start exporting the mailbox data to Office 365 mailbox.

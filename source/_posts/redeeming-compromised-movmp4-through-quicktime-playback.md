 Apple QuickTime Player can be easily downloaded from Apple’s official website, and it is available for Windows and macOS. The basic version of the QuickTime Player is free though QuickTime Player has plenty of advanced features waiting in the Pro version. Some of these QuickTime Player Pro features are:

* New Player
* Open Image Sequence
* Trim to Selection
* Add Movie
* Add to Selection and Scale
* Present Movie
* Poster Frame
* Show Movie Properties
* Loopback and Forth and much more

 But, QuickTime Player doesn’t contain features that can help you [rebuild a damaged MOV or MP4 video](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/) file. Yes, QuickTime Player has many advanced sets of features, but that serves the purposes of playing, trimming, editing, exporting, saving, reverting, and looping video files. Unlike VLC, which can [repair damaged .MOV and .MP4 videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/) , QuickTime Player, lays its hand in repairing a damaged video file.

## **Can you fix QuickTime Black Screen?**

 If a MOV or MP4 video is severely damaged, you may receive QuickTime Player’s Black Screen error message. This black screen indicates the failure of the media player to run your video smoothly. Since QuickTime Player lacks advanced video repair features, you will require professional MP4 and MOV [video repair software](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/) .

### **Check for Movie Inspector**

 In QuickTime Player, click on the ‘Windows’ tab and select the ‘**Show Movie Inspector** ‘ from the bar to know your video file details. It could be of little help because it lets you know details such as– Video Format, Movie FPS, Playing FPS, Data Size, Data Rate, Duration, Resolution, etc. If your video is damaged and QuickTime flashes a black screen error, then the Movie Inspector will inform you about the distortion in the video file’s metadata (if any).

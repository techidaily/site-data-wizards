### #1 Check and fix internet connection

 When you streamline any online video, it may be sluggish, playing in slow motion, or buffer erratically. The problem could be because of a poor internet connection. To fix it, you may test your internet speed using speed checker tools. Make sure that you have an uninterrupted connection while you watch an online video.

 For example: To watch a high-resolution TV show or movie on YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. the minimum internet speed should be at least 1+ Mbps. For smaller online video clips, the speed should be a minimum of 500 kbps. However, to watch Netflix, the internet speed should at least 5Mbps.

 In this case, maybe the internet is not the reason behind videos playing slow. It could occur due to other reasons such as outdated graphic drivers, video corruption, etc. If the video is corrupted, you may try an efficient [video repair tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/) to fix all sorts of corruption in the video.

### #4 Close all applications on PC

 When you try to watch videos on your system and play in slow-motion, it may happen due to several programs running in the background. The videos stored on your system require the computer’s hardware to run seamlessly, especially if you have hardware acceleration enabled. To fix this, you may close all programs and tabs and then try to play the video. Now check if the video is playing properly.

* Open the**Task Manager** and click**End task** to close all the applications on PC. (**See Image 6)**

 _Image 6: Select End task to close the programs_

### #5 Disable hardware acceleration

 Hardware acceleration (if enabled) allows applications, audio cards, and videos stored on your PC to use Windows hardware resources by default. Disabling the hardware acceleration lets the web-based application choose hardware resources requirements rather than PC default settings. The video playing in slow motion error can occur when the PC’s default hardware settings are not enough to play those videos. You may try disabling the acceleration to fix the error. To do so, follow these steps:

* Open**Control Panel > Large Icons View** .
* Click**Display > Change Display Settings** in the left pane.
* Click**Advanced Settings** . If you see the**‘Troubleshooting’** tab in the Advanced Settings, it means that graphics/video card supports hardware acceleration.
* Click**Troubleshooting** and drag the**Hardware Acceleration** slider to**Full** to disable it.
* Click**OK** and restart the system and check if the problem is fixed. (**See Image 7**)

### #6 Update Video Card/Graphics Card driver

 Sometimes, outdated video or graphic drivers maybe another significant reason for videos playing in slow motion on windows 10\. Every video you play on your system is controlled by a video card driver, also known as a graphic card driver. The video card on your system helps in smooth video rendering. Also, it boosts your PC performance. However, outdated or corrupted graphic card drivers may often lead videos to play slowly. It may also cause video lagging, game crash, and other problems.

## **What is unique about ‘Advance Repair’ feature?**

 ‘Advance Repair’ feature is added to deliver more power and better performance to the software. It is a feature that makes the application stand out among other [video repair tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/) in the market. Significantly increasing the success rate of video repair, ‘Advance Repair’ is also a relief for those who lose their videos due to severe corruption.

 The feature uses the technique of ‘Sample File’ as reference to repair videos that are severely corrupt.

 A ‘Sample File’ is a working video file created from the same device and of the same format as your bad video file. For example, a sample file for a corrupt video shot from Canon EOS-1D will be the working file shot from the same camera model. The file can be of any size.

 The software uses the information from the sample file as reference and repairs the highly corrupt videos.

You can repair all kinds of severe visual and audio distortions in the videos through this application.

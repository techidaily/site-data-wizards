### **Method 1: Update VLC Media Player to the latest version**

 If your videos freeze, stutter, or are not playing in VLC Media Player, first update the player to the latest version. The updates improve support for new HD codecs, advanced formats, HDR, H.265/HEVC, 4K & 8K playback, 360-degree videos, VP9 (HD videos at lower bitrates), and others for decoding and encoding. It also fixes streaming issues and bugs, if any.

### **Method 2: Increase cache values in VLC Player**

 VLC Player preloads video cache files in the computer’s RAM to properly access and plays the video. You can try to fix the video buffering issue by increasing the cache value. However, this would increase the number of seconds videos are cached to play in VLC Player.

**Steps to increase cache value in VLC:**

* Open VLC Player.
* Go to**Tools** \>**Preferences** .
* At the bottom-left corner, under**Show settings,** select ‘**All** .’

**Steps to disable hardware decoding in VLC:**

1. Open VLC Media Player.

* Go to**Tools** \>**Preferences.**

* At the bottom-left corner, under**Show settings,** select ‘**All** .’
